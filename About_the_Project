Credit Risk Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Modeling 
Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and builds a classification model to predict credit default risk. It includes data cleaning, visualization, encoding, scaling, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

 1. Objective
To analyze credit-related data and build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit.

 2. Libraries Used
pandas, numpy – for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization
sklearn – for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
GridSearchCV – for hyperparameter tuning

 3. Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset using pandas
Checked for null values and filled them using median imputation
Performed outlier detection using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method
Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Target Variable Distribution: Visualized the class balance of the target column (default)
Correlation Heatmap: Displayed relationships between numeric features
Histograms: Plotted feature-wise distributions
Boxplots: Detected outliers visually
Pair Plot: Explored pairwise relationships among features
Group-by Analysis: Examined average feature values grouped by default status

5. Modeling
Model Used: RandomForestClassifier
Train-Test Split: 80% training and 20% testing
Model Metrics:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Accuracy Score
Feature Importance: Visualized top features influencing predictions

6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Performed tuning using GridSearchCV with:
n_estimators: [50, 100]
max_depth: [5, 10, None]
Identified the best parameter set and corresponding model accuracy

7. Key Insights
Some features showed strong correlation with the target variable
Imbalanced data may affect model performance, requiring techniques like SMOTE (optional)
Feature importance helped prioritize variables influencing default
